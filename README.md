Dinobots - Learning game programming, game analytics, generative Ai, game AI, prompt engineering and reinforcement learning with dinosaurs and robots.

Open-Source "Dinobots" Game AI and Prompt Engineering Project

We started an open-source learning game project called "Dinobots", which will be a platform to teach game programming, game analytics, generative AI, game AI, prompt engineering, and reinforcement learning with dinosaurs and robots.

We have volunteer OPT opportunities to extend this game in Unity 3D and Unreal Engine. The idea is to keep on extending and improving the game to teach various ideas in game programming, game analytics, generative AI, game AI, prompt engineering, and reinforcement learning with practical examples and code.

The source code is available and open-source.  Thanks to Yunhao Yang, Ankur Thakur, Mantravadi Sairam and Mohit Daswani for getting this project started.

Volunteers and students who choose to will have the option to continue working on and enhancing this open-source effort every semester.
